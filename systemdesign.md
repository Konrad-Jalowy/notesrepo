## System Design Notes

### Definitions
- **Forward Proxy/Proxy** - proxy (middleman in communication) - acting on behalf of the client
- **Reverse Proxy** - proxy acting on behalf of the server
- **Latency** - how much time it takes to execute an operation
- **Throughput** - how many operations you can make per time unit
- **Throughput (system design aside)** - aside from system design, throughput is also measurment of speed of data transfer from one device to the other, measured in bps (bits per second)
- **Nines** - what availability you get
- **High Availability** - I believe 5 nines or more (5 nines - 99.999% uptime - 5.17 minutes of downtime per year)
- **SLA** - Service Level Agreement
- **SLO** - Service Level Objective (part of SLA)
- **Host** - physical or virtual machine that runs processes
- **Redundancy (in system design)** - process of replicating parts of the system in order to make it more reliable
- **Redundancy (in programming)** - usually something to avoid, violates DRY principle, having repeted code that can be and should 
be refactored, abstracted away to some function or something like that

### Performance
- **Processing Speed** - frequency of electrical cycles per second, measured in Hz (Hertz)
- **System performance Objectives:**
    - **Minimize Request-Response Latency**
    - **Maximize Throughput**
- **Latency depends on:**
    - **Wait/Idle time**
    - **Processing time**
- **Throughput depends on:**
    - **Latency**
    - **Capacity**


### Tech Stack
- **Apache Webserver** - not very good as reverse proxy
- **Nginx** - good and often used as reverse proxy
- **Apache Technologies** - PHP, Python, Perl, no JSP/Servlets
- **Apache architecture** - based on Request-Response model, client gets persistent conncetion that gets a thread from a threadpool. For static pages, thread can access disk and provide them. For dynamic pages, thread does processing (CPU, Memory, accessing network 
or some service if necessary) and provides content for the client.
- **Apache webeserver disk requirements** - As a general rule, each page fetched requires around 10k of disk overall (for the page cache, its text, the index, db entries, etc.). 
- **Nginx webserver** - based on Event-Driven Async IO Model, all conections have the same thread, that does not leave CPU (which is great for its speed) and if necessary, this thread makes Asynchronous IO Requests
- **Nginx and Apache** - you can combine nginx and apache. Nginx as reverse proxy (load balancer and cache) for apache web servers between them and the client and nginx as reverse proxy (load balancing and cache) between apache web servers and some backend rest api apache accesses.
