- **SaaS (Software as a Service) - centrally hosted (cloud-based), "on-demand software", web-based end user software**
- **SSD (Solid State Drive) - faster than any other technology at reading, only reading from RAM beats it**
- **IP is configured by:**
    - **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**
        - **DHCP - modern implementation of BOOTIP**
        - **DHCP Reservation - excludes IPs from being handed unless they meet a certain condition**
            - **Discover**
            - **Offer**
            - **Request**
            - **Acknowledge**

    - **SYN ->>>**
    - **<<<-SYN/ACK**
    - **ACK->>>**
- **MAC - Media Access Control:**
    - **can be spoofed like IP**
    - **doesn not change even though IP does**
    - **address commonly identified by physical hardware**

- **RAID levels:**
    - **RAID 0 (striping) - 2 hdds (or more), 0 redundancy, you get speed in RAID 0**
    - **RAID 1 (mirroring) - 2 redundant hdds, less space and less speed since you write everything twice but more fault-tolerant**
    - **RAID 5 (striping with parity) - minimum 3 hdds, you can lose 1 drive before losing data**
    - **RAID 6 - minimum 4 hdds, you can lose up to 2 drives before losing data**
    - **RAID 10 (striping mirrors) - striping like in RAID 0 but not over 2 hdds but over 2 hdds + 2 mirrors (mirroring like in RAID 1)**
    - **RAID 0+1 - two striped pairs, first is mirrored by the second**
- **USB standards and their speeds:**

| USB 2.0       | 480 Mbps      |
| USB 3.0       | 5 Gbps        |

| USB 3.1           | Teal              |
| Charging Port     | Red/Orange/Yellow |

- **Charging port - USB port for charging. If desktop is turned off, its still charging.**
