# Fundamentals Notes
## Concepts
### Storage Units
- **Byte** - 8 bits
- **Kilo-** means 1,000; a Kilobyte is one thousand bytes.
- **Mega-** means 1,000,000; a Megabyte is a million bytes.
- **Giga-** means 1,000,000,000; a Gigabyte is a billion bytes.
- **Tera-** means 1,000,000,000,000; a Terabyte is a trillion bytes.
- **Kilobytes (KB)** - 1,000 bytes
- **Megabytes (MB)** - 1,000 Kilobytes
- **Gigabytes (GB)** - 1,000 Megabytes
- **Terabytes (TB)** - 1,000 Gigabytes
### Patent, Copyright, Trademark
- **Patent** - can protect some invention. For example, PC could be patented.
- **Copyright** - protects some intelectual property. For example, a software or a book about programming can be protected by copyright.
- **Trademark** - a logo of your website can be protected by a trademark.
## Infrastructure
### Cables

- **RJ-45** - ethernet cable
### Connectors 
- **USB** - universal serial bus
- **Thunderbolt** - usually on Mac
- **Bluetooth** - self-descriptive
- **RF** - radio frequency connector (remote control for example)
- **Firewire** - usually for external hard drives
### Graphic device
- **VGA** - Video Graphics Array, D-shaped, really hard to not recognize, 15 pins numbered from right up corner to left down corner in 3 rows 
- **HDMI** - High-Definition Multimedia Interface, D-shaped, 19 pins in two rows, first row - odd numbers from 1 to 19 from right to left, second row even numbers from 2 to 18 right to left
- **DVI** - Digital Visual Interface, not very popular nowadays
### Other devices
- **PS/2** - Connector used for keyboard and mouse back in the day. Nowadays replaced by US
    - ***PS2 ports are still on motherboards because they offer better connectivity and lower latency.***
### Drivers
- **Driver** - a software component that lets the operating system and a device communicate with each other.
- **Device manager (menedżer urządzeń)** - a component of the Microsoft Windows operating system. It allows users to view and control the hardware attached to the computer.
