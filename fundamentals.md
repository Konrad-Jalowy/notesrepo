## Mock Exams notes:
### Definitions:
- **IOPS (Input/Output operations per second) - measurement of a disk throughput**
- **GPS (Global Positioning System) - uses satelites for communication, from anywhere on the planet**
- **SaaS (Software as a Service) - centrally hosted (cloud-based), "on-demand software", web-based end user software**
- **SSD (Solid State Drive) - faster than any other technology at reading, only reading from RAM beats it**
- **IP is configured by:**
    - **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**
        - **DHCP - modern implementation of BOOTIP**
        - **DHCP Reservation - excludes IPs from being handed unless they meet a certain condition**
            - **Discover**
            - **Offer**
            - **Request**
            - **Acknowledge**
        - **IPv6 by DHCPv6 Protocol**
    - **Can be statically assigned**
    - **When no static IP and cannot reach DHCP Server:**
        - **APIPA - Automatic Private IP Addressing**
            - **As name suggests, handles private IPs, inside LAN, quick conf without DHCP**
        - **Zero Conf - Zero Configuration**
            - **Modern version of APIPA**
- **Compression - creating single file out of multiple files that occupies less space**
- **Wired connection - better in terms of security than technologies using signals that can be easily intercepted such as**
    - **Wireless**

    - **<<<-SYN/ACK**
    - **ACK->>>**
- **MAC - Media Access Control:**
